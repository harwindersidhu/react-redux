# React Redux
Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments and are easy to test. It centralizes the application's state and logic.

## Overview of this app
This is a counter app in which we can increment, decrement and add to a counter. The application's state is managed by Redux. 

### Summary
- Create a Redux store with `configureStore`
- Provide the Redux store to the React application components.
- Create a Redux "slice" reducer with createSlice
- Use the React Redux `useSelector/useDispatch` hooks in React components
